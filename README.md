# Hi!
I go by Lex Xeno (pronounced Lex Z-ee-no) but you can call me Lex.

I'm a 15-year-old guy (he/him) on the internet with a lot of curiosity and enthusiasm towards the inner workings of computers and the software that runs on them!

Plus, I would love to chat with like-minded people and one day contribute to open source (although I might need a bit more experience)!

## My hobbies are:
* Coding in Rust
* Embedded systems
* Electronics
* 3D art (Blender)

## Platforms:
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealXeno-L/)
* Discord | Lex Xeno#9833
