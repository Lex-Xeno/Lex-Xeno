# Hi!
I go by Lex Xeno but you can call me Lex.
I'm a 14 year old guy on the internet with too much knowledge and curiosity but I'd love to chat with like minded people!

## I'm currently working on:
* redesigning Ubuntu's icons to my liking (and maybe making something to allow others to do the same just with whatever colour they want, but IDK about how I'm allowed to use the Yaru theme and other stuff hence why I might never publish it)

## My hobbies are:
* Coding (Python and -learning- C)
* CAD/3D printing (FreeCAD)
* Video editing (DaVinci Resolve)
* 3D art (Blender)

## Platforms:
* [Redit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealXeno-L/)
* Discord | Lex Xeno#9833
* [Replit](https://replit.com/@LexXeno)

## PC Specs:
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D
* GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT
* RAM: 16GB, 2660Mt/s
* OS: Windows 11 and (dual booting) Ubuntu 22.04
