# Hi!
I go by Lex Xeno (pronounced Z-ee-no) but you can call me Lex.
I'm a 14-year-old guy (he/him) on the internet with a lot of curiosity and enthusiasm towards the inner workings of computers and the software that runs on them!
Plus, I would love to chat with like-minded people and one day contribute to open source (although I might need a bit more experience)!

## My hobbies are:
* Coding (learning more complex features of C++ and Rust and I only know enough of Python for my GCSEs LOL)
* Computer graphics (learning OpenGL and will eventually move to Vulkan)
* 3D art (Blender)

## Platforms:
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRealXeno-L/)
* Discord | Lex Xeno#9833
